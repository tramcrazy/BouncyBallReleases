# Bouncy Ball Releases
**PLEASE NOTE**: currently only the web source files are available - the Java will be added soon.
This repo holds releases for Bouncy Ball, a libGDX-based graphical demo that I produced as part of my first week of graphics programming during my Computer Science A-level studies.
